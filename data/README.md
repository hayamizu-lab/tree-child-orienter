# Networks generated for the experiments

This directory contains the artificial data set, some of which we used in the experiments. 

There are three directories:

- `leaf_n10_experiment1` contains the adjacency matrices of input networks we used in Experiment 1. 
- `leaf_n10_experiment2` contains the adjacency matrices of input networks we used in Experiment 2.
- `leaf_n20_experiment3` contains the adjacency matrices of input networks we used in Experiment 3.

Each directory consists of subdirectories named, for example, `leaf_n10_reticulation_r3`, meaning that the network has 10 leaves and 3 reticulations. 

The adjacency matrix of each network is named, for example, `10_0.1_5_binary_adj.csv`, meaning that the network has 10 leaves and that it is the 5th network generated by the algorithm with a reticulation probability 0.1.
